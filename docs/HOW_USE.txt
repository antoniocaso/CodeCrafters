To correctly launch the project, it is essential to consider its components. First of all, a Zybo Z7 board with a Zynq 7020 System on Chip was used. The code will be imported into Vitis, and it comes with a platform designed for this purpose in Vivado. The application was developed in Vitis, and from there it needs to be flashed onto the Zybo (Run Application or Run as Hardware). The project also includes a file to be used in conjunction with Matlab, which is used to plot (with data received via UART protocol) the calculated speed and acceleration, which are also sent to an OLED screen properly connected to the Zybo (tables.com/Getting-the-PmodOLEDrgb-to-Work-on-Zybo/).

Therefore, first run the Matlab script and, as quickly as possible, flash the application onto the board, so that you can view both the data on the OLED screen and the graph in Matlab.
