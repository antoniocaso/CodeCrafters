# CodeCrafters
Welcome to CodeCrafters! This repository is a collection of various projects and code snippets developed during our academic journey. Here, youâ€™ll find a diverse range of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies that showcase out skills and growth as developers. 

There is a branch for each project. Also, the matlab folder contains the code that has to be executed before quickly flashing the STM32CubeIDE code, so to visualize dinamically what is being sent on the USB.
